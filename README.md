# About
CCC (Comprehensive Character Creator) is a lightweight, browser-based character creator with JSON import and export features.
React is used for state management. Tailwind is used for styling. The layout of the creator should stay simple and easy to use.
The main screen offers intuitive key-value pair editing. For standardization purposes, each component expects matching key names.
For example, when specifying a body part, the outer key name is `body`, and the inner key name precisely identifies the body part.
The values therein can be anything (within reason). This project is developed iteratively and will become more robust over time.
Glossary of key names TBD (and key naming instructions will also be made available within the application).
