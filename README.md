# About
CCC (Cool Character Creator) is a lightweight, browser-based character creator with JSON import and export features.
The main screen allows for intuitive key-value pair editing. For standardization purposes, each sub-screen expects matching key names.
For example, when specifying a body part, the key name should precisely identify that body part.
Glossary of key names TBD (and key naming instructions will also be made available within the application).
